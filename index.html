<p> The goal of this course is to introduce programmers to some
modern software engineering practices, embodied in
advanced functional programming languages. We believe that knowledge
of these modern concepts and practices can greatly contribute to 
better programming, even when writing programs in non functional programming
languages. </p>

<p>The focus of this course will be functional programming in
<a href="http://Haskell.org"><b>Haskell</b></a>.
Haskell is an advanced <a href="./lectures/haskell-intro.html"><i
style=color:red>purely functional, polymorphically
statically typed, lazy</i></a> language, and elegant mathematical
underpinnings. It allows rapid development of robust, concise, correct software.
With strong support for integration with other languages, built-in
concurrency and parallelism, debuggers, profilers,
rich libraries and an active community, Haskell makes it easier to
produce flexible, maintainable, high-quality software. For this
reasons, it is being increasingly used in industry by organizations
such as Facebook, AT&T, and NASA.  </p>


<p>The language is based on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus"><i>lambda-calculus</i></a>
and is named for Haskell Brooks Curry, whose work in mathematical logic serves as a
foundation for functional languages.
</p>

<p> We start with a brief review on basic concepts of functional
programming in Haskell and later explore advanced features of Haskell, such as
functors, applicative and monads, commonly used containner datatypes,
existentially quantified types, algebraic datatypes and others.</p>
