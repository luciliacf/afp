This module implements a persistent version of a common balanced tree
structure: Red Black trees.

It serves as both a demonstration of a purely functional data structure
and as an additional use-case for QuickCheck.

Tree Structure
--------------

A red-black tree is a binary search tree where every node is marked with a
color (red `R` or black `B`).  For parity, we will abbreviate the standard
tree constructors `Empty` and `Branch` as `E` and `N`. (The latter stands for
*node*.)

If it has been a while since you have seen red black trees, [refresh your
memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree).


> data Color = R | B deriving (Eq, Show)
> data RBT a = E | N Color (RBT a) a (RBT a) deriving (Eq, Show, Foldable)

We can determine the topmost color of any (sub)-tree with the following
function.

> color :: RBT a -> Color
> color (N c _ _ _) = c
> color E = B

Furthermore, Red Black trees must satisfy the following
invariants.

  1. Empty trees are black

  2. The root is black

  3. From each node, every path to an `E`
     has the same number of black nodes

  4. Red nodes have black children

* The first invariant is true by definition, the others we will
have to maintain as we implement the tree.

* Together, these invariants imply that every red-black tree is
\"approximately balanced\", in the sense that the longest path to an
empty node is no more than twice the length of the shortest.

* From this, it follows that all operations will run in $O(log_2 n)$
time.

Sample Trees
------------

Here are some example trees, the first one is actually a red/black tree. The
others violate the policy in some way.

> good1 :: RBT Int
> good1 = N B (N B E 1 E) 2 (N B E 3 E)

Here is one with a red Root

> bad1 :: RBT Int
> bad1  = N R (N B E 1 E) 2 (N B E 3 E)

Here\'s one that violates the black height requirement.

> bad2 :: RBT Int
> bad2  = N B (N R E 1 E) 2 (N B E 3 E)

Now define one that violates invariant 4.

> bad3  :: RBT Int
> bad3 = undefined

Not a BST

> bad4 :: RBT Int
> bad4  = N B (N B E 1 E) 3 (N B E 2 E)

All sample trees

> trees :: [RBT Int]
> trees = [good1, bad1, bad2, bad3, bad4]


Checking the RBT invariants
---------------------------

We can write quickcheck properties for each of the invariants.

1. The empty tree is black. (This is actually a unit test).

> prop_Rb1 :: Bool
> prop_Rb1 = color E == B

2. The root of the tree is Black.

> prop_Rb2 :: RBT Int -> Bool
> prop_Rb2 t = color t == B

3.  For all nodes in the tree, all downward paths from the node to `E` contain
the same number of black nodes. (Make sure that this test passes for `good1` and
fails for `bad2`.)

> prop_Rb3 :: RBT Int -> Bool
> prop_Rb3 = undefined

4. All children of red nodes are black. (Make sure your tree above
fails this test.)

> prop_Rb4 :: RBT Int  -> Bool
> prop_Rb4 (N R (N R _ _ _) _ _) = False
> prop_Rb4 (N R _ _ (N R _ _ _)) = False
> prop_Rb4 (N _ a _ b) = prop_Rb4 a && prop_Rb4 b
> prop_Rb4 E = True

And satisfies the binary search tree condition.

We test this condition by checking whether every value stored in the tree
occurs within an appropriate interval.  An interval is specified by two
endpoints, which may be some specified value, or +/- infinity.

> type Interval a = (Maybe a, Maybe a)

We can check whether a particular point is located within the bounds of an
interval.

> within :: Ord a => a -> Interval a -> Bool
> within y (Just x, Just z)   = x < y && y < z
> within y (Just x, Nothing)  = x < y
> within y (Nothing, Just z)  = y < z
> within y (Nothing, Nothing) = True

We then maintain an interval with each recursive call, ensuring that every
value found is appropriate.

> prop_BST :: RBT Int -> Bool
> prop_BST = check (Nothing, Nothing) where
>    check :: Interval Int -> RBT Int -> Bool
>    check (min, max) (N _ a x b) = x `within` (min,max)
>                                   && check (min,Just x) a
>                                   && check (Just x,max) b
>    check _ E           = True

Testing the tests
-----------------

Take a moment to try out the properties above on the sample trees. The good
trees should satisfy all of the properties, whereas the bad trees should fail
at least one of them.

> prop_RBT :: RBT Int -> Property
> prop_RBT x = counterexample "Rb2" (prop_Rb2 x) .&&.
>              counterexample "Rb3" (prop_Rb3 x) .&&.
>              counterexample "Rb4" (prop_Rb4 x) .&&.
>              counterexample "BST" (prop_BST x)

> test_props :: IO ()
> test_props = mapM_ quickCheck (prop_RBT <$> trees)

Arbitrary Instance
------------------

To use quickcheck to check these properties, we need an arbitrary
instance. We\'ll use one based on `insert` and `empty`.  Below, we use the
operator form of `fmap`, written `<$>` to first generate an arbitrary list of
values, and then fold over that list, inserting them into a tree one by one.

> instance (Ord a, Arbitrary a) => Arbitrary (RBT a)  where

>    arbitrary          = foldr insert E <$> (arbitrary :: Gen [a])

>    shrink E           = []
>    shrink (N _ l _ r) = [blacken l,blacken r]

If the `insert` function is correct, then we will only generate valid red black trees.
(If not, then one of our quick check tests will fail anyways).

The shrink function is used by quickcheck to minimize counterexamples. The
idea of this function is that it should, when given a tree, produce some
smaller tree. Both the left and right subtrees of a wellformed red-black tree
are red-black trees, as long as we make sure that their top nodes are black.

All the tests together
----------------------

> main :: IO ()
> main = do

Make sure the RBT is a set

>   quickCheck $ prop_empty  @RBT
>   quickCheck $ prop_insert @RBT
>   quickCheck $ prop_insert_inequal @RBT
>   quickCheck $ prop_elements @RBT

Implementation specific properties.

>   quickCheck prop_RBT

Implementation
--------------

We then just need to implement the methods of the
Set class for this data structure.

> instance Set RBT where

>   empty :: RBT a
>   empty = E

>   member :: Ord a => a -> RBT a -> Bool
>   member x E = False
>   member x (N _ a y b)
>     | x < y     = member x a
>     | x > y     = member x b
>     | otherwise = True

>   elements :: Ord a => RBT a -> [a]
>   elements = undefined


Insertion, is, of course a bit trickier.

>   insert :: Ord a => a -> RBT a -> RBT a
>   insert x t = blacken (ins x t)

We\'ll define it with the help of an auxiliary function.  This recursive
function `ins` walks down the tree until \.\.\.

> ins :: Ord a => a -> RBT a -> RBT a

\.\.\. it gets to an empty leaf node, in which case
it constructs a new (red) node containing the
value being inserted \.\.\.

> ins x E = N R E x E

\.\.\. finds the correct subtree to insert the value, or discovers that the value
being inserted is already in the tree, in which case it returns the input
unchanged:

> ins x s@(N c a y b)
>   | x < y     = balance (N c (ins x a) y b)
>   | x > y     = balance (N c a y (ins x b))
>   | otherwise = s


Note that this definition breaks the RBT invariants in two ways \-\- it could
create a tree with a red root, or create a red node with a red child.

Blackening
----------

Note that `ins` creates a tree with a red root when we insert into an empty
tree.  Our first fix to insert is to blacken the top node of the tree to make
sure that invariant (2) is always satisfied.

> blacken :: RBT a -> RBT a
> blacken E = E
> blacken (N _ l v r) = N B l v r


Balancing
---------

In the recursive calls of `ins`, before returning the new tree, however, we
may need to *rebalance* to maintain the red-black invariants. The code to do
this is encapsulated in a helper function `balance`.

* The key insight in writing the balancing function is that we do not try to
rebalance as soon as we see a red node with a red child. That can be fixed
just by blackening the root of the tree, so we return this tree as-is.  (We
call such trees, which violate invariants two and four only at the root
\"infrared\").

The real problem comes when we\'ve inserted a new red node between a black
parent and a red child.

* i.e., the job of the balance function is to rebalance trees with a
black-red-red path starting at the root. Since the root has two children and
four grandchildren, there are four ways in which such a path can happen.


                 B             B           B              B
                / \           / \         / \            / \
               R   d         R   d       a   R          a   R
              / \           / \             / \            / \
             R   c         a   R           R   d          b   R
            / \               / \         / \                / \
           a   b             b   c       b   c              c   d

* The result of rebalancing maintains the black height by converting
to a red parent with black children.

                                     R
                                   /   \
                                  B     B
                                 / \   / \
                                a   b c   d

In code, we can use pattern matching to identify the four trees above
and rewrite them to the balanced tree.  All other trees are left alone.

> balance :: RBT a -> RBT a
> balance (N B (N R (N R a x b) y c) z d) = N R (N B a x b) y (N B c z d)
> balance (N B (N R a x (N R b y c)) z d) = N R (N B a x b) y (N B c z d)
> balance (N B a x (N R (N R b y c) z d)) = N R (N B a x b) y (N B c z d)
> balance (N B a x (N R b y (N R c z d))) = N R (N B a x b) y (N B c z d)
> balance t = t




Red-Black deletion
------------------

Here is an implementation of *deletion* from Red/Black trees (taken from [1]
below).

Deletion works by first finding the appropriate place in the tree to delete
the given element (if it exists).  At the node where we find the element, we
delete it by merging the two subtrees together.  At other nodes, when we call
delete recursively on one of the two subtrees, we may change the black height
of that subtree, so we will need to rebalance to restore the invariants.

This implementation maintains the invariant that deleting an element from a
*black* tree of height $n+1$ returns a tree of height $n$, while deletion from
red trees (and the empty tree) preserves the height.  Even if the element is
not in the tree we can maintain this invariant by reddening the node (and
potentially producing an infrared tree.) As above, we blacken the final result
to restore this invariant.


> delete :: Ord a => a -> RBT a -> RBT a
> delete x t = blacken (del t) where
> 	del E = E
> 	del (N _ a y b)
> 	    | x < y     = delLeft  a y b
> 	    | x > y     = delRight a y b
>           | otherwise = merge a b

Delete from the left subtree. If the left subtree is a black node, we need to
rebalance because its black height has changed.

>       delLeft a@(N B _ _ _) y b = balLeft (del a) y b
>       delLeft a             y b = N R (del a) y b

Rebalancing function after a left deletion from a black-rooted tree. We know
that the black height of the left subtree is one less than the black height of
the right tree. We want to return a new, balanced (though potentially
infrared) tree.

>       balLeft :: RBT a -> a -> RBT a -> RBT a
>       balLeft (N R a x b) y c            = N R (N B a x b) y c
>       balLeft bl x (N B a y b)           = balance (N B bl x (N R a y b))
>       balLeft bl x (N R (N B a y b) z c) = N R (N B bl x a) y (balance (N B b z (sub1 c)))

Helper function to reduce the black height of a tree by one by reddening the
node. Should only be called on black nodes. We know that `c` above is a black node because
* it is the child of a red node
* `c` must have the same black height as `(N B a y b)` so it can\'t be `E`

>       sub1 :: RBT a -> RBT a
>       sub1 (N B a x b) = N R a x b
>       sub1 _ = error "invariance violation"

Deletion from the right subtree. Symmetric to the above code.

>       delRight a y b@(N B _ _ _) = balRight a y (del b)
>       delRight a y b             = N R a y (del b)

>       balRight :: RBT a -> a -> RBT a -> RBT a
>       balRight a x (N R b y c)            = N R a x (N B b y c)
>       balRight (N B a x b) y bl           = balance (N B (N R a x b) y bl)
>       balRight (N R a x (N B b y c)) z bl = N R (balance (N B (sub1 a) x b)) y (N B c z bl)

Glue two red black trees together into a single tree (after deleting the
element in the middle). If one subtree is red and the other black, we can call
merge recursively, pushing the red node up. Otherwise, if both subtrees are
black or both red, we can merge the inner pair of subtrees together. If that
result is red, then we can promote its value up. Otherwise, we may need to
rebalance.

>       merge :: RBT a -> RBT a -> RBT a
>       merge E x = x
>       merge x E = x
>       merge (N R a x b) (N R c y d) =
> 	  case merge b c of
>           N R b' z c' -> N R (N R a x b') z (N R c' y d)
> 	    bc -> N R a x (N R bc y d)
>       merge (N B a x b) (N B c y d) =
> 	  case merge b c of
> 	    N R b' z c' -> N R  (N B a x b') z (N B c' y d)
> 	    bc -> balLeft a x (N B bc y d)
>       merge a (N R b x c)           = N R (merge a b) x c
>       merge (N R a x b) c           = N R a x (merge b c)


We can also use quickcheck to verify this definition.

> prop_delete_spec1 :: RBT Int -> Bool
> prop_delete_spec1 t = all (\x -> not (member x (delete x t))) (elements t)

> prop_delete_spec2 :: RBT Int -> Bool
> prop_delete_spec2 t = all (\(x,y) -> x == y || member y (delete x t)) allpairs where
>   allpairs = [ (x,y) | x <- elements t, y <- elements t ]

> prop_delete_spec3 :: RBT Int -> Int -> Property
> prop_delete_spec3 t x = notElem x (elements t) ==> (delete x t == t)

> prop_delete_bst :: RBT Int -> Bool
> prop_delete_bst t = all (\x -> prop_BST (delete x t)) (elements t)

> prop_delete2 :: RBT Int -> Bool
> prop_delete2 t = all (\x -> prop_Rb2 (delete x t)) (elements t)

> prop_delete3 :: RBT Int -> Bool
> prop_delete3 t = all (\x -> prop_Rb3 (delete x t)) (elements t)

> prop_delete4 :: RBT Int -> Bool
> prop_delete4 t = all (\x -> prop_Rb4 (delete x t)) (elements t)
