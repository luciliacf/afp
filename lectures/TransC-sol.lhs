This exercise depends on the \"difference list\" library that we worked on
earlier in the semester. Take a moment to remind yourself about this exercise.
(If you didn\'t quite finish it before, do that first or download the solution.)

Testing IO interactions
-----------------------

> -- a)

The Input and Output classes from the [Concurrency](Concurrency.html) lecture
are useful not just for implementing concurrent programs, but they are also a
way that we can test monadic computations that do console I/O.

Here are the definitions that we saw before, describing monads that support
non-blocking I/O.

> class Monad m => Output m where
>    write :: String -> m ()
> class Monad m => Input m where
>    input :: m (Maybe String)    -- only return input if it is ready

> instance Output IO where
>    write = putStr
> instance Input IO where
>    input = do x <- hReady stdin
>               if x then Just <$> getLine else return Nothing

And here is a simple program that does some IO in an arbitrary monad.

> -- | Wait for some input to appear, and when it does, repeat it.
> echo :: (Input m, Output m) => m ()
> echo = do ms <- input
>           case ms of
>                    Just str -> write str >> write "\n"
>                    Nothing  -> echo

If I run this program in ghci, using the `IO` monad by default, I can see that
it just spits out whatever I type in.

            Main*> echo
            Hello        <---- I typed this
            Hello        <---- GHCi printed this

Try it out yourself!

But how can we make a unit test for this (simple) program?

The answer is that we will *mock* the IO monad using a different, pure monad.
Below is a definition of a `FakeIO` monad \-\- it is just a state monad with
two components: a log of all of the lines that were written to the output
and a list of all inputs, which may or may not be ready.

> type FakeIO = S.State FakeState

> data FakeState = FS
>    { fsWrite :: DL.DList String    -- what has been written
>    , fsInput :: [Maybe String]     -- what to read from
>    }

We will eventually be able to run this monad by giving it a list
of inputs and it will give us back the log of `write`s.

         Main*> runFakeIO echo [Nothing, Nothing, Just "Hello"]
         ["hello", "\n"]

We can make this `FakeIO` monad an instance of our two classes by
remembering all of the strings that were written
and by providing access to the inputs, one by one.

> instance Output FakeIO where
>    write s = do st <- S.get
>                 let oldLog = fsWrite st
>                 let newLog = DL.append oldLog (DL.singleton s)
>                 S.put $ st { fsWrite = newLog }


Complete the definition of the input function so that it accesses the
`fsInput` component of current state, returning the head (if any) and updating
`fsInput` to be the tail of the list.

> instance Input FakeIO where
>    
>    input = do st <- S.get
>               let (v,rest) =  case (fsInput st) of
>                                 []     -> (Nothing,[])
>                                 (x:xs) -> (x,xs)
>               S.put $ st { fsInput = rest }
>               return v
>    

We can run the `FakeIO` monad by giving it an initial state.

> runFakeIO :: FakeIO () -> [Maybe String] -> [String]
> runFakeIO comp inputs =
>       DL.toList (fsWrite (S.execState comp initState))
>  where
>       initState = FS { fsWrite = DL.empty, fsInput = inputs }


Here are two examples of unit tests for IO programs.

> testEcho :: Test
> testEcho = runFakeIO echo
>              [Nothing, Nothing, Just "hello"] ~?=
>              ["hello", "\n"]

> testEcho2 :: Test
> testEcho2 = runFakeIO (echo >> echo)
>               [Just "hello", Nothing, Just "CIS 552"] ~?=
>               ["hello", "\n", "CIS 552", "\n"]

Now write a test of your own, for a simple IO progam of your own devising.

> test3 :: Test
> test3 = runFakeIO undefined undefined ~?= undefined

> 

Here\'s yet another way of defining a fake IO monad. In this case, we define a
datatype of the IO operations that record a *trace* of the execution and make
this datatype an instance of the `Monad` type class.

> data TraceIO a = Done a
>            | Output String (TraceIO a)
>            | Input (Maybe String -> TraceIO a)

> instance Monad TraceIO where
>    return               = Done
>    (Done a)       >>= f = f a
>    (Output req k) >>= f = Output req (k >>= f)
>    (Input k)      >>= f = Input (\s -> k s >>= f)

The Input and Ouput classes use these data constructors to record the
interactions.

> instance Output TraceIO where
>    write s = Output s (return ())
> instance Input TraceIO where
>    input = Input return

> instance Applicative TraceIO where
>     pure  = return
>     (<*>) = ap
> instance Functor TraceIO where
>     fmap  = liftM

The main part of the computation is in the `run` function that
interprets a trace using a list of inputs.

> runTraceIO :: TraceIO () -> [Maybe String] -> [String]
> runTraceIO (Done _)       inputs = []
> runTraceIO (Output s dio) inputs = s:runTraceIO dio inputs
> runTraceIO (Input f) (x:xs)      = runTraceIO (f x) xs
> runTraceIO (Input f) []          = runTraceIO (f Nothing) []
> 

A generic concurrency monad
---------------------------

> -- b)

The Concurrency monad that we presented in class was specialized to atomic
actions in the IO monad. But now that we have a mocked version of the IO
monad, we should be more general. Compare this definition of `Action` to the
one from before; this one is *parameterized* by a monad in which the atomic
actions are run.

> data Action m =
>        Atom (m (Action m))           -- an atomic computation, returning a new action
>      | Fork (Action m) (Action m)    -- create a new thread
>      | Stop                          -- terminate this thread

We add this new `m` as an additional argument to `C`.

> newtype C m a = C { runC :: (a -> Action m) -> Action m }

Now, make this new type a monad:

> instance Monad m => Monad (C m) where
> 
>    return x = C (\k -> k x)
> 
> 
>    m >>= f  = C $ \k -> runC m (\a -> runC (f a) k)
> 


> instance Monad m => Applicative (C m) where
>     pure  = return
>     (<*>) = ap

> instance Monad m => Functor (C m) where
>     fmap = liftM


> -- c)

Next, to make sure you follow how these generalizations work, add the type
signatures for our library of concurrency operations. Of course, you can ask
GHCi for these types, but try to figure them out yourself first.

> 
> atom :: Monad m => m a -> C m a 
> atom m = C $ \k -> Atom (liftM k m)

> 
> run :: Monad m => C m b -> m () 
> run m = sched [runC m $ const Stop]

> 
> fork :: C m b -> C m () 
> fork m = C $ \k -> Fork (runC m $ const Stop) (k ())


> 
> sched :: Monad m => [Action m] -> m () 
> sched [] = return ()
> sched (Atom m : cs) = m >>= \ a -> sched (cs ++ [a])
> sched (Fork a1 a2 : cs) = sched (cs ++ [a1,a2])
> sched (Stop : cs) = sched cs

Testing concurrent IO
---------------------

> -- d)

Next, show how to implement input and output for
this new parameterized concurrency monad.

> instance Input m => Input (C m) where
>    
>    input = atom input
>    
> instance Output m => Output (C m) where
>    
>    write s = atom (write s)
>    

(More generally, note that `C` is a *monad transformer*. We can make the
concurrency monad an instance of the monad transformers class, which will
allow it to work gracefully with other monad transformers.)

> instance MonadTrans C where
>     lift = atom

Let\'s define and test a *concurrent* program that does IO.

For example, given an output function:

> example :: Output m => C m ()
> example = do fork (write "Hello " >> write "552")
>              write "CIS"

We can run it in the IO monad

          Main*>  run (example :: C IO ())
          Hello CIS552

Or run it in the *Concurrent* FakeIO monad.

> runCFakeIO :: C FakeIO () -> [Maybe String] -> [String]
> runCFakeIO x inputs = runFakeIO (run x) inputs

> testWrite :: Test
> testWrite = runCFakeIO example [] ~?= ["Hello ", "CIS", "552"]

Write your own example of a (terminating) concurrent program, and a test
demonstrating what it does.

> example2 :: (Input m, Output m) => C m ()
> example2 = undefined

> testExample2 :: Test
> testExample2 = undefined
