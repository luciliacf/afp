## Software ##

* The
[Haskell Tool Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)
is a cross-platform program for developing Haskell projects. It is aimed at Haskellers both new and experienced. It automatically
installs GHC in an isolated location, installs packages needed for
your project, builds your project and allows for testing and benchmarking your projects.

* The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System (GHC) can also be
  installed via the [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) or can be downloaded directly from the website.

* Some way to edit Haskell source files. I use [emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). A tutorial on setting up
emacs for Haskell is [here](https://github.com/serras/emacs-haskell-tutorial). There are many other IDEs for Haskell, and you are free to use whichever one you like. This [git repo](https://github.com/rainbyte/haskell-ide-chart) compares the
features of various IDEs in Haskell.

* Version control. You will need to work on your homework assignments
  collaboratively and some sort of version control that supports
  private repositories is essential. We recommend [git](https://git-scm.com/) or [github](https://github.com/).

## References ## 

* [Haskell.org](https://www.haskell.org/). Top-level page for Haskell open-source community.

* [Standard library documentation](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/libraries/).

* [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org/) is a huge repository of Haskell packages. If it isn\'t on Hackage, it doesn\'t exist. 
Packages can be automatically downloaded and installed from Hackage using the [cabal-install](https://wiki.haskell.org/Cabal-Install) tool.

* Looking for a function but don\'t know what it\'s called? Want to see the documentation for a particular function? 
[Hoogle](https://www.haskell.org/hoogle/) searches many standard libraries and can search either by name or by type.

* [Hayoo](http://hayoo.fh-wedel.de/) is another search engine for theHaskell documentation, which is much more 
complete (it searches all of Hackage).

* If you really want the nitty-gritty details of the Haskell language standard, see the 
[2010 Haskell report](https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/).

* [What I wish I knew when learning Haskell](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/)
  will take you far beyond this course,  but is a good reference for the Haskell ecosystem.

## Reading (recommended books) ##

  * [Programming in Haskell, 2nd Ed.](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html),
 by Graham Hutton, the master of Haskell education, has recently
 updated his textbook. It starts gently and covers the core material
 of this class with clarity and grace.

* [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](https://nostarch.com/lyah.htm),
  by Miran Lipovaca, is a whimsical and easy-to-follow Haskell tutorial, with super awesome illustrations.

* [Thinking Functionally with Haskell](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/publications/books/functional/),
  by Richard Bird. Emphasises the fundamental techniques for reasoning about functional programs,
  and for deriving them systematically from their specifications.

* [Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/), by Bryan O\'Sullivan, Don Stewart, and John Goerzen, published by O\'Reilly.
 A thorough and detailed introduction to Haskell that gets into the nitty gritty of using Haskell effectively in the "real world". 

* [Haskell Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/haskell-cookbook),
by Yogesh Sajanikar. Starts by illustrating the principles of functional programming in Haskell, and then gradually build up your
expertise in creating industrial\-strength programs. The book covers topics such as Functors, Applicatives, Monads, and Transformers, 
and explores advanced topics such as Generalized Algebraic Data Types, higher kind types, existential types, and type families. 

* [School of Haskell](https://www.fpcomplete.com/introduction-to-haskell)
 provides tutorials for beginners through advanced Haskell programmers. 
 
* [Beginning Haskell: A Project-Based Approach](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Haskell-A-Project-Based-Approach/dp/1430262508/) A new textbook, includes a treatment of modern, advanced features.

* [Parallel and Concurrent Programming in Haskell](https://www.amazon.com.br/Parallel-Concurrent-Programming-Haskell-Marlow/dp/1449335942) describes how functional programming matters in the context of multithreaded and multicore architectures.

## Help/community ##

* [tryhaskell.org](http://tryhaskell.org/) gives you a ghci session in your browser, and includes a very simple tutorial. It also features an interface to the #haskell IRC channel.

* The [#haskell IRC channel](https://wiki.haskell.org/IRC_channel) is a great place to get help. Strange as it may seem if you\'ve spent time in other IRC channels, #haskell is always full of friendly, helpful people.

* The [Haskell-beginners mailing list](https://mail.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/beginners) is a good place to ask beginner-level questions.

* The [Haskell-cafe mailing list](https://mail.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/haskell-cafe) can also be a good place to ask questions, but is much higher-traffic.

* [Planet Haskell](http://planet.haskell.org/) aggregates blog posts from the Haskell community.

* There is a [Haskell subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/) for aggregating Haskell-related websites, blog posts, and news.
