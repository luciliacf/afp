## Grading

The course grade will be determined as follows:

* Homework assignments	50%
* Quizzes and Exercises	30%
* Final project	20%

## Active learning

We will use \"active learning\" during lectures. You will need to attend
every  lecture and bring your laptop with you everyday.

There will be graded activities during almost every class. You will
need to read the  lecture notes before class and work through the
exercises.  We may begin class with a quiz that tests whether you have
read the  material and attempted the exercises. We may also have
in-class exercises  that you will need to complete with a partner during class time.

## Group work

 **If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.**

You will may complete both in-class work and most of the homework
assignments  in small groups of two or three students. 
We encourage group work because programming is more than just
correctness; it is also  design and communication, especially with
respect to interfaces and abstractions. You are expected to not just
solve the problems;  but to also talk with your partner(s) about the
design  of your solution.

## Homework/project submission

Homeworks should be uploaded via the class website by the given due
date.  The late period for homework submission will be 48 hours after
the deadline.  Assignments submitted up to 24 hours late will receive
a 10  point penalty. Assignments submitted up to 48 hours late will
receive a  20 point penalty. After 48 hours, no homework will be accepted.

Homeworks may be submitted multiple times to the course website. Only
the  latest assignment will be graded. If that latest submission is
during the late period, then the assignment will receive a late
penalty, even if earlier versions of the assignment were submitted on time.

## Academic Integrity

Learning from your peer students is an important component of any
course.  Therefore, we encourage both high-level (\"What does it mean
to be a fold?\")  and low-level (\"Why doesn\'t my code typecheck?\")
questions among class  members and between different groups.

Learning from web resources and reading code is also vital to your
understanding.  We encourage you to read the blog posts, Haskell
textbooks,  and watch videos.

However, there is a line between referring to freely available and
educational resources,  and deception.
In general: You should never COPY code from any source and present it
as your own.  That\'s plagiarism and it\'s wrong.

If you do take advantage of external resources, you must note this in
the comments  of your code. Be careful of too much web surfing \-\- your
grade will be  based on your contributions, not your ability to search.

Because this is a course and not a developer job, there are times that
we will ask  you to refrain from using standard libraries or referring
to (easily accessible)  solutions. I believe in the importance of
practice so I will ask you to do things that you may believe you have
already mastered.

**Don\'t be a cheater.**

Some reference materials should never be used for this course:
solutions to exercises from other groups in the class, from previous
versions of the class  (or from similar courses at other
universities), or from solutions solicited from Haskell community
sites or Rent-A-Coder.  If you use these sources, I will find out.

Violations of this policy will be dealt with severely. For a first
violation (on a homework assignment), the penalty will be from 0 to up
to triple  loss of credit.
